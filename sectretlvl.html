                THE WITLESS is the secret mission for the LIMBO layer, and can be accessed through the mission 1-1 HEART OF THE SUNRISE. The entire level is a direct reference to the 2016 puzzle/exploration game The Witness.

                ALL-IMPERFECT LOVE SONG is the secret mission for the LUST layer, and can be accessed through 2-3 SHEER HEART ATTACK. It starts seemingly as a text-only horror story, then quickly segues into a dating sim scenario featuring the protagonist and Mirage.

                CLASH OF THE BRANDICOOT is the secret mission for the GREED layer, and can be accessed through 4-2 GOD DAMN THE SUN. It is a direct homage to the Crash Bandicoot series. Its title is wordplay of "Clash of the Brands", along with "Crash Bandicoot".

                I ONLY SAY MORNING is the secret level of the WRATH layer, which is located in 5-1 IN THE WAKE OF POSEIDON. It's located on a small, rainy, and grassy island with a single pond full of black fish in the middle, as well as two separate caves, a cabin with a table, bookshelf, two barrels of bait and kitchen, a dormant Cerberus, a well, and a vast ocean surrounding the island.

                7-S: HELL BATH NO FURY is the secret mission for the VIOLENCE Layer and can be accessed through the mission 7-3 NO SOUND, NO MEMORY. The mission takes place in The Library of Babel, and involves the player going through a seemingly standard level, before being required to "CLEAN UP YOUR MESS!" This is done using a power-washer (to clean up blood), and a vacuum (to clean up "Litter," which includes corpses and giblets), which are both variants of the same weapon, held in slot 6. The exit will open once the player cleans all previously dirty areas.

                SOUL SURVIVOR is the first Prime Sanctum, accessed through the hidden Perfect Door in 3-1 BELLY OF THE BEAST. The door will only open upon achieving a "Perfect" rank on every mission in both the Prelude and Act I.

            <h5 class="main-bod-dark2">WAIT OF THE WORLD is the second Prime Sanctum, accessed through the hidden Perfect Door in 6-2 AESTHETICS OF HATE. The door will only open upon achieving a "Perfect" rank on every mission in Act II, as well as completing P-1 SOUL SURVIVOR. Note that P-ranking P-1 is not a requirement to open the door, though it is highly recommended, as not even being that good is enough for consistency on P-2.
                <br><br>
                P-2 is a significant step up in difficulty from P-1, featuring not only an extremely powerful, multi-phase boss fight, but also a gauntlet of arenas with tight rooms, many enemies, several absolutely diabolical Idols, and almost every non-story boss the player has encountered so far. It is the first level to include Ferrymen as a regular enemy, as well as the first to include Insurrectionists as a regular enemy (excluding secret encounters).
